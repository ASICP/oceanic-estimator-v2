### Multi-Step Wizard Design for Esteemed Ventures Cost Estimator


Here's a breakdown of the information available:

1.  **Application Concept and Purpose**: The application is a **multi-step wizard** designed to estimate the cost and expected time for projects using Esteemed Ventures' SME Agents Service. It aims to help users understand project costs, timeframes, and potential OpEx savings compared to traditional models (60-70%).

2.  **Wizard Overview and Flow**:
    *   **Entry Point**: Users select a preset or start custom for common workflows like "Deal Sourcing" or "Portfolio Optimization".
    *   **5 Progressive Steps**: Clearly defined screens including "Define Your Workflow," "Assemble Your Agent Team," "Estimate Resource Needs," "Set Pricing & Billing," and "Finalize & Simulate".
    *   **Key Inputs Collected**: Detailed lists of inputs for each step, covering task type, complexity, duration/volume, agent types, number of agents, capabilities/limits, resource consumption rates, efficiency factors, pricing models, external factors, and success metrics.
    *   **Defaults from Presets**: Each step specifies how defaults are loaded from predefined presets, which users can override.
    *   **Conditional Logic/UI Tips**: Guidance for UI elements like dropdowns, sliders, auto-fills, and compatibility warnings.
    *   **Validation**: Real-time checks (e.g., agent compatibility) and tooltips are included.

3.  **Predefined Task Presets**: **Eight specific presets** are detailed, covering over 80% of the investment lifecycle. For each preset (e.g., Deal Sourcing, Financial Modeling, Legal Review, Investor Relations, GTM Playbook Implementation, Portfolio Optimization, Marketing Campaign, Back Office Ops), the following information is provided:
    *   **Domain**
    *   **Description**
    *   **Default Complexity/Duration**
    *   **Default Agents (3-6)** – Naming specific Esteemed Agents like Clay, Lyla, Gemma, Finley, Ava, Jax, Kai, Lex, Ivy, Bree, Pax, Mia, Happy, FinanceBot.
    *   **Default Usage (e.g., Calls/Tokens)**
    *   **Default Cost Model**
    *   **Projected Savings vs. Traditional**

4.  **Core Information for a Comprehensive App**: The sources explicitly outline "Core Information to Gather for a Comprehensive Cost Calculator App" across five dimensions:
    *   **Task Details**: Type, complexity, duration/volume, dependencies, success metrics.
    *   **Agent Configuration**: Agent types (with descriptions), number per task, capabilities/limits, assignment rules.
    *   **Usage and Performance Metrics**: Resource consumption rates (compute units, API calls, data transfer), efficiency factors (error rate), scalability options, historical data.
    *   **Cost Structure and Financial Inputs**: Per-agent pricing (tokens, flat rates, tiers), bundled/shared costs, billing model (pay-per-use, subscription, hybrid), taxes, fees, margins, discounts.
    *   **External and Risk Factors**: Market/inflation adjustments, risk buffers, user profile, integration hooks.

5.  **Output Features**: The application should provide an **interactive summary** with a pie chart (agent costs), sensitivity sliders (e.g., adjust error rate), and export capabilities (PDF/CSV). It also includes the 60-70% OpEx savings benchmark. It can also generate reports with IRR projections for credit tasks.

6.  **Technical Notes and Implementation Recommendations**:
    *   **Frontend**: Recommended implementation in React/Vue.
    *   **Backend**: Should pull dynamic defaults from Esteemed Ventures' **SLM/Enterprise Memory System** and integrate the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for real-time pricing from LLMs (e.g., OpenAI/Claude/Groq rates).
    *   **Customization**: Users should be able to "Fork" presets and add agents.
    *   **Dynamic Elements**: Pull live LLM rates via API, use the SLM for preset evolution.
    *   **Metrics Tracking**: Log anonymized data post-wizard to the Enterprise Memory System.
    *   **Testing**: Prototype with sample runs is suggested.

Given this extensive and specific breakdown, a development team would have a strong foundation to proceed with building the task agent cost estimator application.

Based on the provided business and service details from Esteemed Ventures' documents (e.g., the 22+ specialized autonomous AI agents, investment lifecycle workflows, and operational structure), I've designed a **multi-step wizard** for feeding customer data into the cost estimator. This wizard guides users through inputting task-specific details while auto-populating defaults from **predefined task presets**. The presets are derived directly from your AI-native platform's key domains: Investment Ops, Fund Admin & IR, Marketing & Origination, Deal Execution, Post-Close Value Creation, and Back Office.

The wizard ensures comprehensiveness by mapping to the core data categories (Task Details, Agent Configuration, Usage Metrics, Cost Structure, External Factors) while keeping it user-friendly—e.g., via dropdowns, sliders, and conditional logic. It outputs a detailed cost breakdown (e.g., per-agent token usage, total OpEx savings vs. traditional models) and supports "what-if" scenarios.

#### Wizard Overview
- **Entry Point**: User selects a **preset** (or starts custom) based on common workflows like "Deal Sourcing" or "Portfolio Optimization."
- **Steps**: 5 progressive screens, with progress bar and "Back" navigation. Defaults load from preset; users can override.
- **Validation**: Real-time checks (e.g., agent compatibility with task type) and tooltips linking to agent descriptions.
- **Output**: Interactive summary with pie chart (agent costs), sensitivity sliders (e.g., adjust error rate), and export (PDF/CSV). Includes 60-70% OpEx savings benchmark vs. traditional PE.
- **Tech Notes**: Implement in React/Vue for frontend; backend pulls from your SLM/Enterprise Memory System for dynamic defaults. Integrate MCP for real-time pricing from LLMs (e.g., OpenAI/Claude/Groq rates).

#### Predefined Task Presets
These 8 presets cover 80%+ of your investment lifecycle (from sourcing to value creation), based on the 22 agents and workflows in the docs. Each preset pre-fills Steps 1-4 with realistic defaults, drawing from your 60-70% OpEx savings model, multi-model architecture (OpenAI/Claude/Groq), and continual learning cadence. Presets can be expanded via your SLM for custom firm-specific playbooks.

| Preset Name | Domain | Description | Default Complexity/Duration | Default Agents (3-6) | Default Usage (e.g., Calls/Tokens) | Default Cost Model | Projected Savings vs. Traditional |
|-------------|--------|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|

#### Implementation Recommendations
- **Customization**: Allow users to "Fork" a preset and add agents (e.g., spin up task-specific swarms for scale).
- **Dynamic Elements**: Pull live LLM rates via API (e.g., Groq for speed). Use your SLM for preset evolution (e.g., weekly retrain on usage logs).
- **Edge Cases**: Handle high-scale (e.g., 100+ deals) with auto-scaling warnings; include risk buffers for market volatility (e.g., 3% inflation).
- **Metrics Tracking**: Post-wizard, log anonymized data to your Enterprise Memory System for LTV:CAC optimization (target 56:1).
- **Testing**: Prototype with sample runs (e.g., "Deal Sourcing" preset yields ~$50-150 total, 85% margin).

This setup makes the estimator comprehensive yet intuitive, aligning with your AI-native ethos. If you provide sample pricing data or want code snippets for the wizard logic, I can refine further!


TASK:  Esteemed Ventures (EV) SME Agents Service
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
 Build an multi-agent  swarm estimator that helps users know what the project may cost, and time expected for completion using Esteemed Ventures (EV) SME Agents Service

EV Core Agent Swarm Cost Estimator should be based on:
	1. Task
	2. Scale
	3. Performance 

Other items: task characteristics, agent specifics, usage patterns, operational overheads, and financial variables. This ensures the app can model real-world scenarios accurately, handle variability, and provide actionable insights (e.g., cost breakdowns, optimization suggestions).

### Core Information to Gather for a Comprehensive Cost Calculator App

To build a robust cost calculator for a multi-agent service, you'll need to collect data across several dimensions: task characteristics, agent specifics, usage patterns, operational overheads, and financial variables. This ensures the app can model real-world scenarios accurately, handle variability, and provide actionable insights (e.g., cost breakdowns, optimization suggestions).

I've organized the key information into categories below, with examples of why it's important and how it might be input into the app. Aim to make inputs user-friendly (e.g., dropdowns for agent types, sliders for task complexity) and allow for custom overrides.

#### 1. **Task Details**
   These define the scope and drive how agents are allocated.
   - **Task Type/Category**: E.g., data analysis, content generation, customer support. *Why?* Different tasks require specific agent combinations, affecting cost baselines.
   - **Task Complexity Level**: Low/medium/high or a numerical scale (1-10). *Why?* Higher complexity may need more agents or iterations.
   - **Expected Duration or Volume**: E.g., hours/days, number of items processed (like emails or queries). *Why?* Scales resource usage linearly or exponentially.
   - **Dependencies/Sub-tasks**: Breakdown of subtasks and their sequence. *Why?* Reveals handoffs between agents, which incur coordination costs.
   - **Success Metrics/Quality Threshold**: E.g., accuracy rate >95%. *Why?* Low success may trigger retries, inflating costs.

#### 2. **Agent Configuration**
   Focus on the "workers" in your system.
   - **Agent Types Available**: List of agents (e.g., LLM for reasoning, API caller for integrations, validator for quality checks) with descriptions. *Why?* Users select based on task fit; each has unique pricing.
   - **Number of Agents per Task**: Minimum/maximum, or dynamic based on load. *Why?* Parallel agents speed up tasks but multiply costs.
   - **Agent Capabilities and Limits**: E.g., tokens per call for AI agents, API rate limits. *Why?* Prevents overestimation; helps simulate bottlenecks.
   - **Agent Assignment Rules**: E.g., primary agent + backups. *Why?* Models failover scenarios for reliability.

#### 3. **Usage and Performance Metrics**
   Track runtime consumption for precise calculations.
   - **Resource Consumption Rates**: E.g., compute units (GPU hours), API calls, data transfer (MB). *Why?* Core drivers of variable costs in cloud-based agents.
   - **Efficiency Factors**: E.g., average time per subtask, error rate (5-10%). *Why?* Accounts for waste; enables "what-if" simulations (e.g., "What if error rate drops?").
   - **Scalability Options**: E.g., auto-scaling thresholds, batch processing discounts. *Why?* For high-volume tasks, costs per unit decrease.
   - **Historical Data**: Past task logs (if available) for benchmarking. *Why?* Improves accuracy over time via machine learning refinements.

#### 4. **Cost Structure and Financial Inputs**
   Define how costs are computed and billed.
   - **Per-Agent Pricing**: E.g., $0.01 per 1K tokens, $5/hour flat rate. *Why?* Foundation of all calculations; include tiers (e.g., volume discounts).
   - **Bundled or Shared Costs**: E.g., platform fees, shared infrastructure (10% overhead). *Why?* Captures non-agent expenses like orchestration tools.
   - **Billing Model**: Pay-per-use, subscription, or hybrid. *Why?* Affects total cost formulas (e.g., amortized fixed costs).
   - **Taxes, Fees, and Margins**: E.g., VAT rates by region, service markup (20%). *Why?* For end-to-end pricing; make region-specific.
   - **Discounts/Promotions**: E.g., first-task free, loyalty tiers. *Why?* Encourages user adoption; dynamic based on volume.

#### 5. **External and Risk Factors**
   Add layers for realism and forecasting.
   - **Market/Inflation Adjustments**: E.g., annual cost increases (3-5%). *Why?* Future-proofs estimates for long-term planning.
   - **Risk Buffers**: E.g., contingency for delays (add 15% buffer). *Why?* Handles uncertainties like agent downtime.
   - **User Profile**: E.g., enterprise vs. individual, expected usage frequency. *Why?* Tailors recommendations (e.g., bulk pricing for enterprises).
   - **Integration Hooks**: E.g., API keys for real-time pricing feeds. *Why?* Keeps data fresh without manual updates.

### Implementation Tips for Your App
- **Data Collection Method**: Use a multi-step wizard for inputs, with defaults based on task presets (e.g., "Standard email campaign" auto-fills agents and rates).
- **Output Features**: Beyond totals, show breakdowns (pie charts for agent costs), sensitivity analysis (e.g., "Increasing agents by 1 adds $X"), and exportable reports.
- **Validation and Iteration**: Start with MVP data (e.g., just task + agents), then expand based on user feedback. Test with sample scenarios to ensure edge cases (e.g., zero-cost tasks) are handled.
- **Privacy Note**: If gathering historical data, ensure compliance (e.g., anonymize usage logs).

This framework should cover 90%+ of scenarios—start gathering this info via user surveys or prototypes to refine it further! If you share more details about the agents (e.g., AI vs. human), I can tailor it more.
